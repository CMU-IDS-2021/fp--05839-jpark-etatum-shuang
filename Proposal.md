I. Introduction: 

Airbnb has changed the way guests travel with the platform by allowing middle to upper class consumers to find temporary lodging within local communities. However, changes in consumer travel in local and marginalized neighborhoods can have significant impacts on those communities. Our project aims to examine the impact of Airbnbâ€™s growth in Los Angeles. Specifically, we aim to use visualizations of Airbnb data to discuss gentrification within the city. Additionally, we will compare our findings with other studies of gentrification to see if Airbnb data can serve as an indicator of gentrification. Our team will be using data from Inside Airbnb to visualize listing, pricing and property attributes. We evaluated data across 2015 to 2021 to evaluate trends across pricing (per night and weekly), listings, reviews and locations. We will be taking a narrative approach to our data and storytelling. 

First, it is important to define gentrification and which trends can be used as indications of it. Gentrification is the process by which neighborhoods are transformed such that neighborhoods that were once housed and catered to marginalized populations are impacted by an influx of middle and upper class residents which shifts the power dynamic and resource options available in the neighborhood. Cheap, affordable housing is critical to support the livelihood and support for marginalized populations. Los Angeles is a multicultural metropolis of different ethnicities, cultures and incomes within the city. 

We evaluated gentrification trends in Los Angeles based on published government data published from the city of Los Angeles. Some of the highest density areas that have been impacted by gentrification are Hollywood and Venice. This gave us a high level baseline to compare our data findings. We also did research around factors that contribute to gentrification to guide our decisions for specific visualizations. 

II. Experimental Design 

We decided to leverage Streamlit due to its flexibility to support multiple visualizations and its frictionless deployment capabilities. We decided to use several different packages to support our visualizations including pandas, NLTK, folium, seaborn, and altair. First, we evaluated the data available at Inside Airbnb. The site provides several csvs including a calendar, listing and review dataframe. An evaluation of the structure of the data is available within our Streamlit application. Our team began investigating different aspects of the dataset to create visualizations and trends around our raw data.

III. Findings

We found that Airbnbs with the highest Airbnb prices and density tightly correlated with the migration of underserved communities. Similarly in the vain of gentrification tools, we saw that the highest prices and listing Density: Hollywood, Venice and Echo Park. We also saw that Airbnb pricing continues to rise for housing, reducing accessibility for short term housing for local communities. The average price and weekly prices have continued to soar with the density of listings in the areas driving potential price gouging and demand spikes.

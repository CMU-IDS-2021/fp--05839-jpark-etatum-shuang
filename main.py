# Introduction
st.header("Project Purpose")
st.markdown("Our project aims to examine the impact of the growth of Airbnb in Los Angeles and tying the data visualization to gentrification within the city. Our team will be using data from Inside Airbnb to visualize listing, pricing and property attributes. ")

st.header("Project Background")
st.markdown("Gentrification is the process by which neighborhoods are transformed such that neighborhoods that were once housed and catered to marginalized populations are impacted by an influx of middle and upper class residents which shifts the power dynamic and resource options available in the neighborhood. ")
st.markdown("Airbnb has changed the way guests travel with the platform by directly embedding middle to upper class consumers within the community. This subsequently has significant impacts on the community where consumer temporarily reside. The popularity of Airbnb has driven investment property moguls to purchase low income housing that is necessary for the livelihood of low income households. ")


st. markdown("Although Airbnb emphasizes empowering local home owners to supplement their income, Airbnb disproportionately impacts consumers in low income areas. Additionally, residents shape resources that is desirable in these areas. ")
